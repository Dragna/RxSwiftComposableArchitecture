          to find frames corresponding to one of your reducers. That code should be refactored to \
          not invoke the effect directly.

          * The store has been sent actions from multiple threads. The `send` method is not \
          thread-safe, and should only ever be used from a single thread (typically the main \
          thread). Instead of calling `send` from multiple threads you should use effects to \
          process expensive computations on background threads so that it can be fed back into the \
